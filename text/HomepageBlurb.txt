I lecture and help students online with difficult STEM classes and assignments.
I love working together with my students to develop a well-rounded understanding of the topics at hand from a foundations-first approach. I want each student to feel as if they could have invented what they learned themselves.
Additionally, I help students with practical advice - such as providing textbooks & online resources, assistance with navigating majors and classes, and time management tips - which is just as integral for student success.
I haved tutored university students for over 4 years. I graduated with a B.S. in Mechanical Engineering and a B.A. in Mathematics from Texas A&M University. Due to coursework overlap, I have tutored students majoring in Mathematics, Bio-sciences, Business, Art, Engineering, Chemistry, and Computer Science.
Let's work towards your full potential, together!
