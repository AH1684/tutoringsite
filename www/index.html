   <h2>About Me</h2>

   </aside>
   <p>I lecture and help students online with difficult STEM classes and 
    assignments.
   <p>I love working together with my students to develop a well-rounded 
    understanding of the topics at hand from a foundations-first approach. I want 
    each student to feel as if they could have invented what they learned 
    themselves.
   <p>Additionally, I help students with practical advice - such as providing 
    textbooks &amp; online resources, assistance with navigating majors and classes, 
    and time management tips - which is just as integral for student success.
   <p>I haved tutored university students for over 4 years. I graduated with a B.S. 
    in Mechanical Engineering and a B.A. in Mathematics from Texas A&amp;M 
    University. Due to coursework overlap, I have tutored students majoring in 
    Mathematics, Bio-sciences, Business, Art, Engineering, Chemistry, and Computer 
    Science.
   <p>Let&#39;s work towards your full potential, together!
